# Welcome to D-FACTO (Decentralized Fact-Checked Objectivity) 

### What is D-FACTO?

D-FACTO is a framework that uses open networks to provide transparency and ensure objectivity on research studies and government provided statistics.

### Decentralized Research System framework

The framework for D-FACTO is fairly simple:

1.	Initiate research through the D-FACTO
The first step in commissioning research through the D-FACTO will be to publish the initial research specification and disclosure of the funding party on a DSP. This information will be cross referenced on the data collected for that study. 

2.	Incentivize data collection.
The steps to initiate data collection are to develop data scrappers, incentivize data collection, data saving on a DSP, and reporting the data on-chain. The raw data (prior to clean up or outlier detection) collected will be saved on a DSP during the data collection phase and its address saved on chain to ensure no tampering. 

3.	Allow time for data collection and raw data publication.
4.	Finalize research. 
The last step on research funded through D-FACTO is loading the finalized methodology and computer programs to a DSP for easy recreation and objectivity inspection. 

Future research for D-FACTO:
â€¢	Decentralize peer-review

# Decentralized fach-checked objectivity (D-FACTO)

D-FACTO is a framework of trust building through verification. 

Many sanctioned surveys, research projects, and studies are paid for by organizations with conflicting interest and the reported conclusions are not always as objective as they should be. With an open system where all the data is available transparently, credibility and objectivity can be regained even when there is a conflict of interest between the funding party and the conclusion. This applies to both, government and privately sanctioned studies. 

Anyone that is truly data driven and is not misusing studies to only support their marketing strategy should be open to higher degree of transparency than what is currently available. 

The framework for the D-FACTO is focused on transparency:

1.	Initiate research through the D-FACTO
The first step in commissioning research through the D-FACTO will be to publish the initial research specification and disclosure of the funding party on a Decentralized Storage Platform (DSP)(e.g. IPFS, once data is saved in IPFS the hash of the data becomes the address. This prevents tampering with the data since changing the data would change the hash/address of the information). This information will be cross referenced on the data collected for that study. 

2.	Incentivize data collection.
The steps to initiate data collection are to develop data scrapers, incentivize data collection, data saving on a DSP, and reporting the data on-chain. The raw data (prior to clean up or outlier detection) collected will be saved on a DSP during the data collection phase and its address saved on chain to ensure no tampering. 

3.	Allow time for data collection and raw data publication to a DSP.

4.	Finalize research. 
The last step on research funded through D-FACTO is loading the finalized methodology and computer programs to a DSP for easy recreation and objectivity inspection. 

Future research for D-FACTO:
â€¢	Decentralize peer-review
